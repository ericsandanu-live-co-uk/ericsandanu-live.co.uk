1. **PR**: [#516 RFC: Deprecated packages UX revamp](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/516) - @ruyadorno
  - @ruyadorno 
    - last step in cleaning up `npm install` output
    - this has been outstanding for quite a while
    - deprecation warnings can be consolidated (making them less scary)
    - suggest bubbling up this information in a different command like `npm ls`, `npm explain` or `npm outdated`
    - suggest scoping this under a command `npm deprecations` but not super attached to this
  - @fritzy
    - immediate thought, don't think we need a dedicated command or global flag
    - when something is installed global, we probably don't care about dev dependency
  - @darcyclarke
    - instead of removing the log messages, maybe just change the level of logging to something that would not be printed during a standard install
    - also add visual feedback to `npm outdated`
    - not sure about adding info to `npm explain`, if we were to do that we should pb augment explain output to add audit info, etc
  - @lukekarrys
    - maybe keep direct dependencies as warning logs during install?
    - security audits, deprecations and outdated seem to be very similar, what if there's a command that can surface all this info?
  - @darcyclarke
    - if we were to keep warning for direct dependencies why would we not have log warnings for audit reports for direct deps?
  - @ruyadorno
    - idea is to have a unified notifications system at the end instead
  - @darcyclarke
    - `npm ls` can also be a bit of a scope creep in the context of this RFC since you could also argue it can also be augmented to include audit issues and more
  - @ruyadorno 
    - let's maybe reduce the scope to only notifications and a command to surface the deprecation messages
  - @darcyclarke
    - the command `npm deprecations`? just returns direct dependencies by default and accepts `--all` flag in order to show deprecations for transitive deps
3. **PR**: [#4260 feat(arborist)(reify): add an ability to add a hook](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4260) - @fritzy
  - @darcyclarke
    - During the npm7 rewrite the hooks feature was dropped
    - Maybe that wasn't as well publicized like other breaking changes such as peer dependencies
    - There's a current RFC to add new lifecycle events for arborist / npm installs
5. **Issue**: [#511 [RRFC] remove &#x60;npm-shrinkwrap.json&#x60; from the list of unignorable files](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/511) - @ljharb
  - Update: need to action on the items from last week  
6. **PR**: [#4227 Change the default save-prefix from ^ to none](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4227) - @zkldi
  - Update: need to action on the items from last week  
7. **PR**: [#343 RFC: npm workspaces: auto switch context based on cwd](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/343) - @ruyadorno
  - @ruyadorno
    - big gap between our current implementation & the way end-user's are expecting this feature to work
    - running a command within a directory that is apart of a workspace should be easier
    - we'll now walk up the require tree & determine if you're inside a workspace or not
  - @fritzy
    - PR that is open checks for if a workspace is defined at the root of the project
    - there's a way to opt-out from the behavior using `--no-workspaces`
