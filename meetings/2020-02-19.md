### Notes:

- [2] A combination of requests from the community
- [2] People are currently using an OTP and *not* passing it to get this behaviour currently
- [2] Use this as a launch pad to start prompting people to use 2FA
- [2] Q: Would that prompt happen in a *non* TTY environment?
- [2] Should behaviour like current behaviour in a TTY environment
- [2] Make sure / have some thinking around, should this be opt-in or opt-out, maybe depends on if you have 2FA
- [2] Worry about alert fatigue
- [2] opt-in if you have 2FA enabled (?)
- [2] Have it as a general npmrc config setting; you can enable if you want it, or it’s the behaviour as current
- [2] CLI setting rather than CLI flag
- [2] opt-out unless you have 2FA, then out-in if you have 2FA
- [2] Q: why would 2FA change the behaviour of this function? (it wouldn’t?)
- [2] Q: 2FA is on the server side, so the client probably doesn’t know it; 2FA should probably be the default sooner rather than later
- [2] Q: if this is completely opt-in is there real value in it?
- [2] npm@7 should be opt-in, next major update can be opt-out. This gives us a chance to collect feedback also
- [2] Lots of consensus on doing the above point.
- [3] recap: on the last call, was worried about dev experience; specifically people installing from the staging area
- [3] This is *not* a way for you to distribute pre-release versions; we have mechanisms for that (dist-tags, etc)
- [3] Installing from the staging area should be a sanity check for the author
- [3] Addition; it doesn’t touch package.json / package-lock when you install from staging
- [3] Possibly redirecting the tarball (does enable people to use it as a beta release channel; frowned upon)
- [3] Addition; explicitly opt-in to staged installs (versions of packages that have staged values)
- [3] --staged on a regular install will fail
- [3] The entire purpose was to make a “secret” publish from CI, without 2FA, and since no 2FA make this version *inaccessible* to others
- [3] Seems like; Idea of original RFC has been conflated with multiple workflows
- [3] Points of feedback from node tooling group: the thing that you publish with a prerelase dist-tag isn’t the same as the final product, is because it’s a new tarball
- [3] (Isaac) described specific case of dist-tags not being enough
- [3] (Isaac) described a scenario of “transactional” publishing of multiple deps
- [3] (Isaac) described auth scenario of unscoped package that is staged
- [3] (Emelia) described scenario of circular deps; bringing maintainer of lerna in on this conversation
- [4] (Emelia) summarized the RFC
- [4] (Wes) posted link about a spec for OAuth browser based app flow https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-00
- [4] Action: implementation details should be added to the RFC
- [4] Seems like; consensus on idea (this should get done)
- [6] (Darcy) Put this on our radar as an item to be looked at

--- 3 minutes remaining

- [7] (Ruy) summarized the RFC 
- [A] Talk about having more meetings to address all the topics that come up
- [A] Should have an off week deep dive into one or two RFC’s that are “particularly juicy” (Isaac’s words)
- [A] Seems like; consensus on this idea
- [A] Action: (Darcy) to create issue proposing new days and times for the off week deep dive RFC call
