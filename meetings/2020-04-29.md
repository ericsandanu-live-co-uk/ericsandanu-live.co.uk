### Notes
- workspaces: standardizing set of npm commands that will be supported with npm workspaces
- Discussion on how to filter a subset of workspaces that is intuitive and nice: 
    + workspaces/ws should be aliases not different commands
    + long and short version of filter parameter
    + explicit option names with no positional arguments
    ```
    npm ws <workspaceName> <command>
    vs.
    npm ws <command> <--config> <workspaceName>
    ```
    + npm config flags on the cli are also configurable through the .`.npmrc` file
    + concerns on the syntax of the command, syntax should be clear enough to express what it does with just reading it
- overrides: only the first match at a given spec will be honored
- opt-out optional deps: legit problem, terrible UX, a user should be able to opt-out of optional deps
- scenario where i dont want optional dependencies to be installed by default
- discussions on what's the best UX for this feature, without having to add new things to the API
- agreed on revisiting it later (maybe npm v8)
- remove `npm outdated --depth`:
    * current use case seems to be only `--depth=9999`
    * this change would align with how community uses `outdated` & the fact `update` is already removing this
    * concerns on adding a new flag that impacts other commands since flags are global
- types: add a single flag that declares that types are included on the package
- type config that declares where the types are and not only if the package includes them
- find a more informative way than a boolean field that we can include on the package.json
