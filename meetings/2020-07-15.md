### Notes

### Preference on how to filter workspaces
- Using a named argument like `npm --workspace=foo test` translates to adding a new config value and aliasing it to `-ws` would be easy
- Adding `npm workspace` as a new command is also trivially easy
- The third option doing `npm :foo test` means adding a new setting config and is potentially costly to implement. Isaac suggest staying away from it
- Isaac leans towards keeping this as a config value
- Poll will stay open for another week

### Add file+pack dependency protocol
- How do we differentiate between wanting a local dep being symlinked or packed/unpacked?
- We can do it at a project level were all files are symlinked or all are packed and in this scenario this could be handled with a config value
- If it has to be per dependency, using a protocol might be better
- Making it a config value makes implementation easier, few changes on CLI and Arborist
- Next actions: change RFC from protocol to config flag

### overrides
- We'll stick with `.` syntax instead of `@` sign
- Will land after 7.0

### Add publish confirmation prompt
- +1 ratified
- queue up for 7.0?
    - it's opt-in, so not semver-major
    - isaacs: pushing back on anything in 7.0.0, could we do 7.x?

### Adding types information to the Package JSON in the  registry
- "waiting on npm to do the work" situation
- next steps: add feedback on rfc, ratify and implementation

### Parent package.json
- Allows a package.json to extend a parent package.json to share dependencies and more between multiple packages
- Hard to implement, target to a lot of problems
- The RFC will stand a bit longer to give people chance to take a look at it

### Expand list of ignored files
- We should include files that could leak secrets (ex. `.env`)
- Add a prompt confirmation before publish that shows you files that you don't want on your package (might need a different RFC)
- Tierney suggests taking a close look at what Node currently ignores: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore
- Ruy to create a different RFC
