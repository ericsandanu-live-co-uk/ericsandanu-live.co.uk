### Notes

#### **Issue**: [#497 [RRFC] Warn users when skipping alias/git deps during audit](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/497) - @rotem-cider
- @darcyclarke
  - we're planning to revamp `npm audit` & `npm install` output to make this issue less relevant 
  - explicitely defining which deps get audited & whu will help mitigate confusion

#### **Issue**: [#999 [RRFC] Custom logging location ](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/499) - @EvanCarroll
- @lukekarrys
  - currently `npm` owns the cach directory
  - we're looking to separate the logs from the cache/log directory
  - we will only let you determine the directory path & not the file name
  - :+1: to this - is a net-new flag
- @fritzy
  - we should maybe name this appropriately like, `--unmanagedLogDir` or something similar
 
#### **Discussion**: [#496 Mention workspace in run-script output header](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/discussions/496) - @smhg
- ...

- @darcyclarke
  - :+1: for this
  - aligns with the work we'd like to do
- @lukekarrys
  - likes this
  - would have treated this like a bug fix if it didn't come through discussions
  - prefixing is very interesting/compelling as well 
- @naugtur
  - can `publish --dry-run` support this aswell?
- @darcyclarke
  - yes, let's have any workspace-aware command support logging the context 
 
#### **PR**: [#481 RFC: Run &#x60;prepare&#x60; Scripts for Linked Bundled Dependencies](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/481) - @mysterycommand
- @mysterycommand
  - no update
  - was able to get a hacky work around for this
  - only works one level deep
- @fritzy
  - 
- @darcyclarke
  - sounds like `yarn` doesn't support this either
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @mysterycommand to investigate how yarn handles this
  - [ ] @darcyclarke to investigate https://turborepo.org/docs/features/pipelines 
 
#### **PR**: [#488 Make npm install scripts opt-in](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/488) - @tolmasky
- @naugtur
  - has done some investigation here
  - worked with maintainer of lavamoat

#### **PR**: [#375 Define which dependencies are shared among workspace projects](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/375) - @isaacs
