### Notes:

#### Clarify/Outline the RFC Withdrawal Process & Amendment
- Ability to not implement something that we previously ratified
- Ratified, Wes, Ruy and Isaacs thumbs up, no objections

#### RFC: Remove --depth from npm outdated
- No objections, doesn't seem to need any amendments
- Adding a new `--all` flag on `outdated` affects all commands
- There are other cases where we might want to use the `--all` flag (ex. `npm ls`)
- `--all` is meaninfully different from other flags
- Add physical AND logical paths?
- Logical path is hard from an output point of view since there are manye entries per dep, potentially growing exponentially
- The problem of finding logical paths might be solved by different tooling other than `npm outdated`

#### RFC: Add `npm-app-id` HTTP header
- HTTP header may contain `npm-app-id` variable which may be used in third-party applications
- Provide a hook for assigning metadata to an application
- "general purpose metadata hook"
- What are the applications/risks? Applications go way beyond the audit example presented on the RFC 
- Wes to add more examples/comments to the existing discussion

### RFC: npm diff
- Ability to compare two packages (local and/or in the registry)
- Similar to `git diff`
- Complementary to `npm outdated`
- Thoughts on uses-cases, developer experience, etc
- Things like `name-only`, similar to git diff (only changed file names)
- Ruy doing a POC
- npm argument parsing is different from git, so matching it exactly as git does might be tricky or not possible

### RFC: Notification system for cli updates
- remove current update-notifier logic from the cli
- cli send the user-agent, specifiying the current version of the cli and the server answers back in case there is an updated
- state of the registry engineering resources makes it difficult to add new features to the registry right now

### RFC: Adding types information to the Package JSON in the  registry
- main feedback is that instead of just using a binary parameter make the "types" field more explicit
