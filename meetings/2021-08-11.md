### Notes

#### Review Action Items from [previous deep-dive call](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/meetings/2021-08-04.md)
- @darcyclarke will provide an update &/or reference to backlogged work to be done to investigate UX/UI `npm audit` improvements 
 
##### **PR**: [#18 npm audit and audit-resolve.json](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/18) - `@naugtur`
- @isaacs https://github.com/npm/arborist/pull/301 requires changes

##### **PR**: [#182 RFC: npm audit licenses](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/182) - `@bnb`
- @bnb no update
- @isaacs notably the license SPDX string is not being included in lockfiles (will need to be added to corgi docs)
- [ ] **Action:** queue up adding the metadata to corgi docs w/ the registry team
 
##### **PR**: [#422 RFC: audit assertions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/422) - `@bnb`
- @bnb: updated PR with some information, will update a bit more in-meeting to address "limiting scope"
- https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/3452
 
#### **RRFC**: [#430 Improving workspace terminology](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/430) - `@jasonwilliams`
- @isaacs 
   - ~"language is hard"
   - provided feedback/insight in the originating discussions here: https://github.com/npm/feedback/discussions/510
- @darcyclarke 
   - has tried to map/visualize these terms as they relate to a 
   - [ ] **Action:** make PR to amend original **Workspaces** RFC a picture/visual of our terminology w/ glossary
- @fritzy 
   - believe our definition is fine so long as we're consistent & glossary is explicit
- [ ] **Action:** Add glossary to npm/cli docs ([rough draft](https://github.com/npm/feedback/discussions/510#discussioncomment-1155331))
- [ ] **Action:** editorial pass through existing npm/cli docs to make sure we're using these terms properly
- [ ] **Action:** (nice to have) Automatically link words in docs to their glossary definitions (this might be too noisy/complicated?)

#### **RRFC**: [#428 npm publish should tell you the end point it's pushing too.](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/428) - `@EvanCarroll`
- @naugter would be nice to have it print prior to 2fa prompt
- [ ] **Action:** add registry target config output when using `npm publish`
- [ ] **Action:** consider other commands that we may want to provide this output/context (start with write operations at first)

#### **RRFC**: [#427 npmrc file improvements](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/427) - `@EvanCarroll`
- @isaacs 
  - have been considering improvements internally
  - this initial discussion/issue doesn't go as far as we'd like if we're going to make a breaking change to `.npmrc`/config
  - `npm install --regsitry=foo` <- typos don't throw (ie. infinite options/config)
  - lets eliminate `nopt`
- @naugter
  - consider making this an ecosystem package first & make it optional before shipping it by default 
- @darcyclarke 
  - what about something like `--thrown-on-unkown` to curb the infinite supported config problem we have today 
- [ ] **Action:** audit config / propose a more comprehensive RFC

#### **RRFC**: [#425 npm-unpublish should have some type of warning when unpublishing package](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/425) - `@pranavkhapra`
- @wraithgar want to be mindful that this would be specific to the npm public regitry's policies
- @naugter this shouldn't be that distructive given the current policy around a 24hr window
