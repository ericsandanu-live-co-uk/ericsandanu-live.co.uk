### Notes

#### **Issue**: [#472 [RRFC] Only use registry provided URLs to fetch tarballs](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/472) - @iarna
- @iarna 
  - scoped packages cannot be installed in certain situations/scenarios, specifically when the registry destination is replaced 
  - this is a change from v6 to v7
  - scoped vs. unscoped modules behaiving differently is definitely a bug
  - replacing/rewriting the registry destination is definitely a bug
  - in this proposal
    - the registry that is used to create the lockfile will get stored
    - the lockfile should be recalculated if the registry changes & there's an integrity mimsatch/invalidation
- @isaacs
  - agree
  - the registry rewriting was incosistent prior to v7, we doubled down on standardizing on some magic swapping 
  - should track the registry in the lockfile
  - need to ensure we nerf-dart the registry value before storing it back in the lockfile
- @ljharb
  - would have been nice to get ahead of this & have a single entry for unscoped/bare packages & then another for each scope (reducing lockfile churn)
- @isaacs
  - an interesting scenario we should consider is when someone installs `npm install foo --registry=bar` & then does the entire tree need to be resolved again based on that new registry?
  - suggestion: could consider this scenario to be a good use-case for scopes (ie. if you have a subset of dependencies that resolve from a different registry then use a scope)
- @bnb
  - what is the structure being proposed/changed?
- @isaacs
  - any changes to `packages`/`dependencies` need
- @bnb
  - how doe scoped registries apply in this?
- @isaacs
  - the proposal is currently just a single registry
- @bnb
  - perhaps we could have a duplicate of the single registry to dictate how scoped registries resolve
- @iarna
  - that could work
- @isaacs
  - using something like `@foo:registry:<url>` would work. (paraphrased code example)
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @iarna to make RFC/PR
  - [ ] @darcyclarke to backlog work for lockfile changes

#### **Issue**: [#473 [RRFC] npm outdated (npm >= 7.24.2) exit with incorrect status code](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/473) - @nassau-t
- @wraithgar 
  - we should have this decision documented
- @isaacs 
  - old versions of npm (ex. v6) exited 0 & we broke this in v7 & then fixed it (ie. this is working as intended) 
- @ljharb
  - we should document npm's ideologies 
- @iarna
  - wierd/nuance which deviates from some of these standards/ideologies `npm` should have is that: the error code does not get set if you pass `--parseable` or `--json`
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @darcyclarke create a doc that outlines npm's ideologies
  - [ ] @darcyclarke close RFC & other issues related to exit code statuses, referencing this new document

#### **Issue**: [#471 [RRFC] Exclude node_modules from Time Machine backups (macOS)](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/471) - @probablykasper
- @ljharb
  - this has been a pain for awhile
- @darcyclarke
  - should this be opt-in?
  - even though we think no one relies on this today, there always is someone that ends-up being broken by a change like this
- @bnb
  - personally prefer opt-out
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @darcyclarke backlog work item to investigate this work & initially ship under a minor in v8 as opt-in & v9 as opt-out
