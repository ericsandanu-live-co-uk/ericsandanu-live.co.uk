2. **PR**: [#525 Stop storing &#x60;integrity&#x60; for git dependencies](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/525) - @nlf
  - @ruyadorno 
    - what if we steered users away from git dependencies in general? 
    - maybe we throw warnings
    - maybe we start notifying we're deprecating
    - definitely on board with this idea
  - @ljharb
    - git deps should only be for development
    - how do file dependencies behave? we should mimic that experience
  - @fritzy
    - we should warn when we see transitive dependencies that are gi deps
  - @ljharb
    - maintainers would have to fork & publish
    - deprecation indicates discouragement
    - not sure this is a good thing in anyway
  - @ruyadorno 
    - we could do this under a config value to skip git dependencies (ex. `--ignore-git-deps`) 
  - @ljharb
    - Node has a Policies feature
    - npm could/should probably support this
    - Package authors' declared policies / capabilities
4. **PR**: [#522 Option for npm diff to ignore cr at eol](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/522) - @oBusk
  - @ruyadorno 
    - we should do whatever `git diff` does/supports
    - lets follow the naming of the `git` flag
    - keep open for another week & then ratify   
5. **PR**: [#4260 feat(arborist)(reify): add an ability to add a hook](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4260) - @fritzy
  - @fritzy
    - clarify they are not the author
    - should be careful about what hooks we add as features
    - WIP RFC
6. **PR**: [#519 RFC: Package Distributions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519) - @darcyclarke
  - @darcyclarke
    - no updates yet but seeing a lot of traction in the community
  - @ruyadorno 
    - are we going to open a diff PR for the "Expanding optional dependencies conditions"?
    - this would mean it's easier/faster to get market validation
  - **Actions:**
    - [ ] @darcyclarke Schedule a working session to review Package Distributions & Optional Dependenyc Conditionals  
7. **Issue**: [#438 [RRFC] Add libc fields to select optionalDependencies should be installed or skipped](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/438) - @Brooooooklyn
