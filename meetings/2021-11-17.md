### Notes

#### **PR**: [#493 RFC: Add npm copy](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/493) - @everett1992
- @everett1992
  - interested in this after seeing another in-flight RFC
  - can help supprt multi-app usecases
  - alternative is that we fix `pack` (ie. make it workspace aware) 
  - ref. implementation: https://github.com/everett1992/cli/pull/1
- @mysterycommand
  - believe this can be worked around with the two current RFCs we've & one that hasn't been written (ie. shared layout)
- @isaacs
  - `pack` could/maybe should have a flag to support this
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @darcyclarke to backlog work for fixing publish/pack w/ bundled dependencies
  - [ ] @everett1992 to open a PR with an updated version of the current `copy` implementation 

#### **PR**: [#486 RFC: Resolved registry overrides](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/486) - @everett1992
  - started an implementation
  - needs advice on how to wire up config/options
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] sync up w/ team async to help move this forward (async Slack call or sync Meeting/Pairing)

#### **PR**: [#488 RFC: Make npm install scripts opt-in](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/488) - @tolmasky
- @tolmasky
  - high-level: surfaced data around usage
  - [0.6%]() of packages use some level of install scripts (roughly ~12k)
  - seems like it's getting close to "human-scale"
  - may mean there could be outreach done to engage this community & determine usage (ie. "how are you using this?")
- @bmeck
  - should consider transitive dependencies that rely on these ~12k packages
  - although the usage of install scripts 
- @tolmasky
  - non-trivial to calculate the impact to those adjacent packages
- @bmeck
  - the node.js project has done this kind of work before (has taken roughly a week)
- @pouwerkerk
  - trying to surface 
  - need to establish the criteria/requirements before doing investigation
- @mylesborins
  - BigQuery could be an option to help doing queries
  - deep trees are hard to update
  - making a change like this will break things
  - q: "what workflows are we breaking?"
    - examples like electron, node-serial-port
  - q: "what are the usecases?"
  - npm scripts are a place where delivering malicious code can occur, but not the only one
  - the problem we're trying to solve for is that there are highly relied upon packages that have been compromised
  - maybe we try to add many new features to address this without enforcement
- @naugtur
  - has been building scripts to help investigate this problem space
  - idea about how we can opt-in to trust scripts:
    - 1. add a note in package-lock for has install scripts
    - 2. add check to see if a package has a net-new install script
- @tolmasky
  - agree & it would be nice if that information should live in `package.json` if possible
- @bnb
  - `package-lock.json` should never be a thing that is intended for human use
  - its intended for machines/the npm CLI
- @naugtur
  - `package-lock.json` is better for this use-case (if we're considering only the cli would track presence of scripts, not humans)
  - `package.json` is famously too overloaded with other configuration
- **Data:**
  - need to include `binding.gyp`
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @bmeck to help query the registry to find ecosystem impact of install scripts (not just direct package usage)
  - [ ] @darcyclarke to open up RRFC/RFC
