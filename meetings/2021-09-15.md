### Notes

#### **Issue**: [#454 ðŸ“Š Poll: new name for the proposed reification strategy (RFC #436)](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/454) - @darcyclarke
- @issacs
  - it makes sense to name this after the intended result/purpose of the strategy (ie. isolate dependencies from eachother)
- **Action:** 
  - @darcyclarke to close poll issue
  - @vincentbailly to update RFC to reflect "isolated" mode nomenclature

#### **PR**: [#436 New Reification Mode](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/436) - @vincentbailly
- @vincentbailly
  - made updates to RFC based on interop between the default strategy & "isolated" mode 
  - can you interop?
    - you can set this w/ configuration & update/change between the modes (ex. force this or have the developer choose) 
  - junctions or symlinks?
    - junctions
- @ljharb
  - we should not create a situation where we are disadvantaging packages or creating more of a support burdan for maintainers
  - we shouldn't be warning people for things that arent actionable for them (ie. end-users/consumers)
  - ex. a third-party package can currently be relying on the non-isolated mode reification which I can't fix
- @isaacs 
  - believe its more likely that, based on the popularity of `pnpm` & `yarn` that we need to eventually support a mode like this
  - believe these is value in a super strict reification mode
- @ljharb
  - believe that `pnpm` & `yarn`+`pnp` are hiding the # of breakages in the ecosystem by asking for maintainers to change & hack support
- @jonathancreamer 
  - a strict package manager mode has help find issues/errors within my dep graph
  - you can resolve some of these issues 
- @vincentbailly
  - your dependencies can still access other deps that they haven't declared if they are top-level/root-level declared deps
- @ljharb
  - so I can tell someone who comes to me & says "I tried isolated mode & eslint broke because of your plugin, what should I do?" I can tell them to "add the plugin as a primary dep & that should resolve your problems"? &
  - does `pnpm` have a similar strategy/capability baked-in?
- @vincentbailly
  - yes
- @isaacs 
  - this RFC is not specific to workspaces but is much more powerful in workspace projects
- @isaacs
  - `root -> workspace(foo) -> bar` does this get linked?
- @vincentbailly
  - we can decide, no strong opinion
- @ljharb
  - we should keep in mind the concept of "isolated for me & not for you"

#### **Issue**: [#445 [RRFC] Breaking changes for &#x60;npm@8&#x60;](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/445) - @nlf
- @wraithgar
  - changes include:
    - no more programmatic API
    - no more support for node 10
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @wraithgar determine which version of node is appropriate to jump to

#### **PR**: [#437 RFC: Robust Lifecycle Scripts](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/437) - @fritzy
- @fritzy no update yet

#### **PR**: [#422 RFC: audit assertions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/422) - @bnb
- @bnb no update - requires some clear next steps
