2. **PR**: [#343 RFC: npm workspaces: auto switch context based on cwd](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/343) - @ruyadorno
  - @ruyadorno
    - this RFC outlines `npm`'s behaivour when you run a command inside a workspace folder & automatically detecting
  - @ljharb 
    - Are the bullets here still accurate: https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/343#issuecomment-806075598
    - There's different models of workspaces
  - @ruyadorno
    - will document the example of using a `.npmrc` file within a workspace child before landing
3. **PR**: [#516 RFC: Deprecated packages UX revamp](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/516) - @ruyadorno
  - @ruyadorno 
    - have updated the RFC to include 
    - expanded on `npm deprecations` usage
    - took some references from @ljharb's `npm-deprecations` package
  - @ljharb
    - `--only=production` / `--omit=dev` should work with this
    - aka. `npm deprecations --only=production` should work
  - @ruyadorno 
    - let's document the details of the args implementation before landing / accepting it
4. **Issue**: [#523 [RRFC] &#x60;npm explain&#x60; should work even absent a lockfile and node_modules](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/523) - @ljharb
  - @ljharb
    - idealtree should be able to give us enough information to generate an `npm explain` result
    - we should warn/error better
  - @ruyadorno 
    - believe we're missing information in idealtree
    - currently we look at actualtree for this command
    - virtual tree might also miss some info (e.g: optional dependencies) so fallback silently might be a dangerous option
    - let's look and se if it works with `--package-lock=only` having it be an opt-in could be a great option so that we can surface these possible differences to users
5. **Issue**: [#438 [RRFC] Add libc fields to select optionalDependencies should be installed or skipped](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/438) - @Brooooooklyn
  - @ljharb
    - would be nice to add a top-level group key to handle this along with os/cpu and other info that might affect installation of optionalDependencies
  - @ruyadorno
    - Reason I surfaced this Issue is to possibly open a separate RFC to improve/expand scope of optionalDependencies and not only the one off `libc` usecase
6. **PR**: [#519 RFC: Package Distributions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519) - @darcyclarke
  - @darcyclarke
    - will follow up async on these discussions  
7. **Issue**: [#511 [RRFC] remove &#x60;npm-shrinkwrap.json&#x60; from the list of unignorable files](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/511) - @ljharb
  - @ljharb
    - there aren't many scenarios where this would break someone
    - expectation is that this file is ignored if I explicitely remove it in `.npmignore`
  - @wes 
    - the capture set would be super small if we allowed `.npmignore` to define `shrinkwrap.json`
  - @ruyadorno 
    - still semver-major either way
8. **PR**: [#4260 feat(arborist)(reify): add an ability to add a hook](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4260) - @fritzy
9. **PR**: [#4227 Change the default save-prefix from ^ to none](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4227) - @zkldi
10. **PR**: [#522 Option for npm diff to ignore cr at eol](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/522) - @oBusk
11. **PR**: [#525 Stop storing &#x60;integrity&#x60; for git dependencies](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/525) - @nlf
