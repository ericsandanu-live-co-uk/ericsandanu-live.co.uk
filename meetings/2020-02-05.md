### Notes:

- [1.a] speak to the code of conduct; we have one, please take a look at it
- [2] no qualms
- [2] will need to backlog for wubwub to support multiple funding sources on the website
- [2] (ACTION): Darcy to create ticket representing this work
- [3] Q: RFC talks about user permission, no where in the RFC does it mention how does it manage 2FA
- [3] Implied that the auth token will bypass 2FA (limited permissions)
- [3] Q: terminology “packages”
- [3] you would have only one “instance” of a package at a version semver
- [3] Might need to clarify this in the RFC
- [3] how does that interplay with semver?
- [3] Term: packument = metadata of a package
- [3] meta around publish and promote; should capture the user who does these actions
- [3] `npm_user` is the person who published it
- [3] Q: who promoted it?
- [3] Add new field for who promoted the package instance from a staged version to a published version
- [3] lets say a developers machine is compromised, you want to be able to go through and find all possible packages they published as per an audit flow
- [3] part of the complexity of delivering this, ironing out the details around auth tokens and permissions. Different set of users who are allowed to publish / promote
- [3] there is some yaks to shave to get the details for the registry ironed out
- [3] ship with just “all users who have publish, will also have promote”; first step (better than nothing, and waiting until perfect)
- [3] mini viable server support, corgi / packument sync (staged versions)
- [3] ACL will be tricky; in addition to 2FA
- [3] location of tarballs will have to be though; due to cache timeouts
- [3] ACTION(isaacs) write up considerations for package artifact urls, staged package urls, impacts on lockfiles, what happens when a staged version is updated/promoted between lockfile creation and usage.
- [4] we’re going to be selective about what “stuff” we pass into the environment when running npm scripts
- [4] already in arborist, there are some new environment variables being added to the run of the npm scripts
- [4] `npm_command` seems to be like a main variable to add (or keep?)
- [5] “depth” is not what you might think
- [5] since we’re deduping and moving packages to the root of the tree
- [5] you can have packages at different logical deps
- [5] if we do update a module at a depth, that can change the depth another module of that name is now found (because of deduping and semver)
- [5] `npm update foo` should now update all modules named `foo`
