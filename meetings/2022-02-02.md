1. **PR**: [#4335 Make &#x27;npm install --loglevel warn&#x27; Output Quieter](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4335) - @DabeDotCom
  - @ruyadorno 
    - want to have no output at the end of `install` 
  - @lukekarrys
    - have been working on this 
    - seems like a case by case for specific output   
3. **PR**: [#516 RFC: Deprecated packages UX revamp](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/516) - @ruyadorno
  - @ruyadorno 
    - cleaning up output of `install` ever since v7
    - deprecation warnings are the last set not consolidated into a single line of output (ex. `found 9 deprecated packages & need your attention`)
    - `npm deprecated` | `npm deprecations` for listing current deprecation notices
  - @rarkins
  - @darcyclarke
    - add `--no-deprecations`  opt-out flag
  - @ljharb
    - deprecation warnings for transitive dependencies should not be bubbled up
    - `npm deprecations <pkg>` to see current deprecation notices for a specific package
  - @ruyadorno 
    - we talked about this before, to have `npm deprecations`  work like `npm ls` & need `--all` to see everything
4. **PR**: [#4260 feat(arborist)(reify): add an ability to add a hook](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4260) - @fritzy

10. **PR**: [#519 RFC: Package Distributions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519) - @darcyclarke
  - @ljharb would prefer to see the RFC tackle a more broad set of usecases for distributions/variants
  - @darcyclarke the current proposal is purposely very focused on a narrow set of usecases so that we can provide an optimal experience f...
  - @ruyadorno 
    - this is essentially a first-step
    - this provides an initial set of distribution conditions
    - we can have future rfcs incrementing optionalDependencies / distributions
