### Notes:
- Discussions on implementation: 
Find one override and we're done: once there's a match we will not apply any other overrides, whether is string or object values
- String and object values like:

```json
{
  "typescript@^3.8": "3.7",
  "react": "15",
  "react@15": {
    "loose-envify@1": "1.3.1"
  },
  "tap": {
    "react": "16.13.1"
  }
}
```

Reference: https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/isaacs/overrides/accepted/0000-overrides.md#object-overrides 

- Isaac: We have to treat string and object overrides differently, this affects how we merge and deduplicate packages
- Overrides field string structure on `package.json`:
**left hand value**: a name package specifier, github repo link with at a particular branch/commit
**right hand value**: an unnamed package specifier that uses alias specifiers
- Examples:
```
"foo": "npm:@fancy/foo@${VERSION}"
"foo": "npm:@fancy/foo"
"foo": "https://my-registry/foo/-/foo-${VERSION}.tgz"
“foo”:  “latest”
```
- If you match the left hand value it gets overriden by the right side
- Challanges: figure out which overrides are relevant at a given point of time in the code
- Good aligntment of what should be included in v1
- - Wes talks about company/team wide package restrictions
- shouldn't take the config out of the thing it is trying to config
- npm has no concept of team-level configs
- v1: npm install and then re-install to get overrides? We assume we get overrides from somewhere
- Jordan: overrides on the packument?
- Isaac to update the RFC with ideas discussed (version defaults, capture groups, sharing configs etc)
