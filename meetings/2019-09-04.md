### Notes:

1. Welcome & Introductions    
Tierney: Want to discuss RFCs accepted but not implemented
Isaac: How do we address backlog of RFCs (including ratification)
Next steps:
Darcy to create an issue on npm/rfcs to highlight & discuss acceptance criteria (ie. ratification) & backlog

2. #43 Peer dependencies installation

Tierney: Issues with how npm handled ordering (ex. acorn deduping/resolution)
Isaac: Options...
Potentially open to other RFC around singletons
should identify dependencies vs.
package identifier (ie. https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/23/)
Tierney: Potentially hide features behind feature flags to play nice with pnpm, yarn etc.
Isaac: `--auto-install-peer-deps` -esque flag
Next steps:
Modifications coming to RFC (Isaac)
Support might be able to land with npm v7

3. #47 Unlisted dependency support

Isaac: 
Don’t want to break other package managers (ex. pnpm)
Onus on npm to fix
Community is already working around this (ex. Angular flattens /w config flag, npm-doctor etc.)
Tierney:
Advocating for explicit command
Next steps:
RFC: check code for unlisted deps in `npm doctor`
RFC: print warnings at runtime for `npm test` under tink (npm >= v8)

4.  Review/converse on sustainability & support drafts

Wesley: 
package maintenance WG looking at how to better support the maintainer that wants to communicate *support*
`backing` overlap with *sustainability* proposal
Isaac:
Schema itself looks perfect
Problems with number of changes that object may see
Next steps:
npm to provide feedback on existing issues/drafted spec
Draft an RFC on npm/rfcs once there is consensus from Package Maintenance WG
