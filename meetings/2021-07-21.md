### Notes

#### **Issue**: [#412 [RRFC] Include gitHead when publishing from subdirectories](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/412) - @iarna
- @iarna pretty minimal change & PR already exists to add `gitHead` (ref. https://github.com/npm/read-package-json/pull/80)
- @isaacs let's do it
- [ ] **Action:** pull in PR / cut release

#### **Issue**: [#411 [RRFC] npm init should also initialise git repo if it git is installed or the folder is not a git repo already](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/411) - @Rafi993
- @ljharb personal workflows do not benefit from this but understands `npm` has favored `git` historically
- @wraithgar seems like a feature request
- [ ] **Action:** comment back w/ references to this call & ask for RFC to be created potentially outlining favoring interacting w/ `git`

#### **PR**: [#403 RFC: Add &#x60;preunpack&#x60; life cycle script](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/403) - @ryansonshine 
- @ryansonshine 
  - synopsis of the RFC is to introduce a lifecycle event that runs before a package is unpacked
  - currently no way forward for folks that relied on v6 `preinstall` behaivour
- @isaacs 
  - .
- @ljharb
  - there is often confusion with these lifecycle scripts as to what context you are setting these up for (ie. in a project consuming a package vs. the package that is being installed) 
  - `preinstall` should happen before a dependency is installed
  - name should dictate how this lifecycle events run (ie. `preinstall` runs before `install`)
  - we need to make it clear between the use cases/contextxs & when those things run
- @wraithgar we should introduce a net-new `lifecycle` object & leave `scripts` to be only used by `npm run` in a future major version but respect both in the interim
- @naugtur if we intend to move away from this altogether should fix the behaivour of `preinstall` to mimic v6
- [ ] **Action:** need an RFC for net-new lifecycle
- [ ] **Action:** issue a patch to revert to v6 functionality

#### **PR**: [#343 RFC: npm workspaces: auto switch context based on cwd](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/343) - @ruyadorno
- @isaacs 
  - no updates, really
  - we're going to be implementing a workspace root identifier (ex. `-w=.`) to `arborist`
  - we have considered support a workspace root config that can be defined in workspaces `.npmrc` files (ex. `workspace-root=../`)

#### **PR**: [#273 RFC: npm workspaces - Config management](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/273) - @ruyadorno
- @darcyclarke 
  - this RFC needs to get updated
  - removing agenda label for now 
- @isaac need a new champion

#### **PR**: [#182 RFC: npm audit licenses](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/182) - @bnb
- @bnb
  - draft PR is open & WIP
  - doesn't have much time to invest right now

#### -- Improvements to audit - @naugtur
  - @naugtur 
    - draft PR is now ready for review against `arborist`
    - [ ] **Action** review issue filed in `npm/cli` for [`npm audit fix`](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3534) 
    - [ ] **Action** review issue filed in `npm/cli` [missing vulnerability information](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3534)

## Parking Lot

- [ ] **Action** add backlogged item to have `npm` use `git` to determine if it's operating inside a git dir (ie. modify `@npmcli/git`)
