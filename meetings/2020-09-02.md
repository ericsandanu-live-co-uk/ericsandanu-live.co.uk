### Notes

#### Announcement: npm7 beta pre-release
- Please make sure to try it out: `npm i -g npm@next-7`

#### Issue [#211 [RRFC] Registry per package on the same organisation](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/211)
- context: mixed hosted packages private/public
- share usage of a single **scope** in between registries
- Isaac: One small downside is the potential to create multiple codepaths in order to support that functionality
- Isaac: One other thing we've seen in the past is a way to define registry per-package in package.json
- Action item: Arnaud to follow up and turn this into an actual RFC

#### Issue [#192 [RRFC] New subcommand “npm clone”](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/192)
- Isaac: some bikeshed on how the options look like, tricky part is wether or not we install dependencies upon cloning
- A package with a git repository, being able to clone that repository to a folder
- What about having an analagous version of `npm clone` that can fetch from the registry instead and extract to file system just like `pacote extract`
- We can also handle monorepos in which `repository` points to a directory
- It could also try to figure out versions/tags from which to clone from
- Jordan: Tag conventions can be tricky, many diff standards, v1.0.0 vs 1.0.0 vs folder/path@1.0.0, etc
- Isaac: Mostly needs to figure out the UX but the idea looks good
- Meta to flesh 

#### Issue [#191 Add registry identifier to publish prompt.](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/191)
- Yes, we'll do this.

#### Issue [#146 RFC: Notification system for cli updates](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/146)
- Remove references to update notifier
- Update the RFC
- Isaac: npm/pnpm/yarn send user agent headers w/ who they are & their version
- Isaac: on the registry, send back latest version of specific cli for use, or to ignore (saves rountrips)

#### PR [#210 RFC peer-specific overrides](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/210)
- Isaac: Last time we landed on just focusing on `overrides`
- Killian: would like to expand more on the idea
- Killian: Right now there's optional peers, why is that so?
- Isaac: Optional peers is something that the other pkg managers implemented first (yarn, pnpm)...
- Jordan: Conceptually a peer dep that does not have to exist for the project to work
- Isaac: A `peerOptional` if can't be fetched or can't be placed in the install tree won't be treated as a critical failure that breaks the install
- Jordan: Some history, there were some part of the cosystem that see peer deps as optional and wanted to treat it that way, so folks advocated for it
- Isaac: The previous default behavior of not installing peerDependencies led to these misconceptions
- Killian: How should it handle pre-releases?
- Isaac: Last time we talked about loosening the peer dep requirement so it would allow pre-releases in order to make sure we could install the current install tree
- Isaac: Let's maybe rollback on that idea, it doesn't sound too great coming to think of it again.
- Killian: (From the current peer overrides RFC) What if:
  ```
    ROOT has dep on A
    A has peer of B
    A has dep on C
    C has peer of B
    B is overridden with X by ROOT does C get requested peer B or override X
  ```
- Isaac: In this case C would get the overriden version X
- Isaac: Next version of the `npm7` beta will ship with support to `npm install --force` to force the install tree to use the top most declared peer dependency
- Jordan: Would like to see a command for helping debugging users that **are** using overrides.
- Isaac: We want to rework the output of `npm ls` to better highlight types of deps and more, so maybe this is going to be part of that work?
- Isaac: Overrides are project-level only
- Jordan: Maybe add a WARNING to `npm publish` highlightning the fact that overrides can not be published to the registry.
- Isaac: We don't want author publishers to have that much control over the install tree but at the same time we don't want folks to publish broken packages to the registry
- Killian: Have overrides trickle down the install tree so that they can be shared
- Isaac: It reduces the power the end-user has over their dependencies
- Isaac: Another usecase end-users that want to replace all usages of a certain package for some reason (say `foobar@1.4.2` has an issue) they can push for overriding that specific version down to the entire install tree without having to care about nested packages **also** overriding their sub-install tree
- Killian: This diff of behavior is the reason why the peer overrides can be a separated RFC, since there's diff of behavior between overriding a regular dep vs a peer dep
- Meta: Yeah overrides should be final
- Meta: if you choose to override it, no other thing can talk you out of it
- Meta: I think we need a use-case diagram for this one to bar out all the possible tricky cases
- Darcy: We may want to update the current Overrides RFC to be explicit and include these difference of behaviors and how the overrides mechanic is going to work in the context of peer deps

#### PR [#209 RFC: provide download counts by versions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/209)
- Darcy: It's a registry feature we heard many times

#### PR [#195 RFC for check engines requirements on every install](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/195)
- Jordan: Essentially the RFC wants `--engine-strict` to be the default again
- Jordan: I think it's very critical that engine mismatch does not fail the install, still support surfacing that info to the end user
- Isaac: 
  - Significant portion of package authors tend to be very defensive about the supported engines, e.g: Author doesn't tests package in node@8 anymore so it will declare `"node": ">=10"`
  - We made the decision in the past for engines strict to not be the default
  - Worth talking about is not making engines strict default, that's not going to happen since it's too disruptive, the thing worth talking about is not engine stricts.
  - Suggestion is to reevaluate for engine strictness anything that is in package-lock file that would otherwise not be evaluated.
  - Adds unnecessary work to the installer that might not need to be done,  so might be an opt-in
  - We still use engines declaration in the algo to decide what dependency to place in the install tree
  - If you want to ignore things from package-lock and install the install tree again, you probably want to `npm update` anyways
  - We could maybe add an option to `npm update` to only reevaluate a subset of packages from the package-lock
- Follow up with comments in that PR
