### Notes

### Parent package.json
- Problem description: managing multiple packages, would be great to reuse info across these
- might be a very difficult problem to solve due to the complexities of the JavaScript ecosystem
- workspaces in npm7 could also open up more possibilities (maybe challenges?)
- implementation ideas:
  - no package.json extension at install time
  - disallow publishing of extensions keys to the registry
  - [read-package-json](https://github.com/npm/read-package-json) / [read-package-json-fast](https://github.com/npm/read-package-json-fast)
  - add logic to merge package.json during pack tarball time
  - we could ship it in a v7-minor release
  - need research to land in the exact key to use in package.json
  - TS currently uses "extends"
- if we allow users to extend from published versions in the registry it gets way harder to build the ideal install tree (might need to add read-package-json as a pacote dep, etc)
- should it be a ref to published package or to a file?
- limiting consumption to exclude git-specs already simplifies by a lot the surface for end consumers that would not have to deal how package authors publish tags, etc
- def have some details to be figured out

### Preference on how to filter workspaces
- Let's document the results in the RFC

### Add publish confirmation prompt
- RFC ratified :+1: 

### Audit resolve
- @naugtur updated the RFC and updated JSON Schema

### Add ability to skip script hooks
- Fix to strange behavior of `--ignore-scripts` in `npm run-script`
- When running `npm test --ignore-scripts` it's more intuitive to skip `pretest` and `posttest`
- Could it be tweaked to ignore specific lifecycle (e.g `postinstall`) when running `npm install`?
  - ref: https://npm.community/t/add-ignore-script-scripts/4169/18
  - That should be a diff RFC/discussion
- RFC ratified :+1: 

### npm audit licenses
- license checker built into npm cli itself
- command: `npm audit license`
- might interact with the audit resolve proposal on how to block/ignore/allow results
- should be part of the default `audit`, some niceties like having results at install time
- missing a better control at level, since some of the problems might not have a solution, same as current `audit` implementation (are probably going to be better once audit resolve is available)
