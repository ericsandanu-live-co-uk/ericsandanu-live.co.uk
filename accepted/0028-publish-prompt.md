# Publish confirmation prompt

## Summary

Publishing a package should prompt a confirmation prompt, allowing users to validate their package info and the target registry before uploading their package tarball.

## Motivation

Breaking the prompt into a two-step operation allows for a validation of contents prior to uploading the package.

## Detailed Explanation and Rationale

`npm publish` should ask for a confirmation prompt prior to uploading the package tarball.

Currently "publish" has a very nice **unintended UX** for users with 2FA enabled, in which it stops the publish process in order to ask for the OTP code, allowing for a review of the file contents (and even cancelling the process altogether) prior to uploading the tarball file.

A broader population of package authors can benefit from this UX if we formalize it. Allowing for review of contents and cancellation of package publishing.

### Feedback from the discussion around this RFC

- Should be implemented behind an opt-in flag for npm@7
- Non-TTY environments should skip the prompt.

## Alternatives

1. Not implement it, keep the current behavior.

## Implementation

Prompts the user for confirmation when using the opt-in flag:

```sh
$ npm publish --publish-confirmation

npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  disparity@3.0.0
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===

This operation will publish your package to the npm registry at https://registry.npmjs.org.
Do you wish to proceed? [y/N]
```

The user can also provide a `--yes` option that can skip the prompt and keep current behavior:

```
$ npm publish --publish-confirmation --yes
```

## Prior Art

Currently `npm publish` will automatically publish the tarball to the registry without any confirmation prompt in case the user does not have OTP enabled.
